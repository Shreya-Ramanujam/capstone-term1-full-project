<br><h2>How bad is the plastic?</h2><br>
<p>The program showed how plastic is polluting our oceans and affecting our wildlife. ... This means that over 240 billion plastic bottles became plastic waste and began polluting our already fragile ecosystem. This is a global problem on an enormous scale and is causing irreversible damage to our planet.
    100 million marine animals die each year from plastic waste alone.
    <br><br>
    100,000 marine animals die from getting entangled in plastic yearly â€“ this is just the creatures we find! 1 in 3 marine mammal species get found entangled in a litter, 12-14,000 tons of plastic are ingested by North Pacific fish yearly. Image result for who much plastic is getting polluted? Plastic waste entering the seas is increasing each year with much of the plastic entering the seas is in particles smaller than 5 millimeters. As of 2016, it was estimated that there were approximately 150 million tonnes of plastic pollution in the world's oceans, estimated to grow to 250 million tonnes in 2025.

    <br><h2>Harmful Effects of plastic to the environment.</h2><br>
 <p>The major impact of plastic bags on the environment is that it takes many years for them to decompose. Besides, toxic substances are released into the soil when plastic bags perish under sunlight and, if plastic bags are burned, they release a toxic substance into the air causing ambient air pollution. When we burn plastic the chemical substance is released into the atmosphere and damages the ozone layer. This is the main reason why the ozone layer is getting damaged day-by-day. It does not damage only the animal it also affects human health.

 <br><h2>How does the plastic affect Human Health?</h2><br>
 <p>Microplastics entering the human body via direct exposures through ingestion or inhalation can lead to an array of health impacts, including inflammation, genotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and necrosis, which are linked to an array of negative health outcomes including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, ...</p>

<br><h1 id="health">How Does Plastic Increase Global Warming?</h1><br>
<p>As it does, sunlight and heat cause the plastic to release powerful greenhouse gases, leading to an alarming feedback loop. As our climate changes, the planet gets hotter, the plastic breaks down into more methane and ethylene, increasing the rate of climate change, and so perpetuating the cycle...
