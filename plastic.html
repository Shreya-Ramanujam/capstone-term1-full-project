        <h1 class="plastic">Statistics of usage of Plastic</h1><br>
        <p>The world uses over 500 billion plastic bags a year â€“ that's 150 for each person on Earth. 8.3 billion plastic straws pollute the world's beaches, but only 1% of straws end up as waste in the ocean. <br> In 2020 the number of plastics in the sea is higher than the number of fish. <br>Every day approximately 8 million pieces of plastic pollution find their way into our oceans. There may now be around 5.25 trillion macro and microplastic pieces floating in the open ocean. <br> Weighing up to 269,000 tonnes. Plastics consistently make up 60 to 90% of all marine debris studied.
